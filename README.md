# Universal-Sets
This is a c project. The user will insert characters and create 2 differents sets(S and T). 
Then a series of messages will appear, showing:

  1)The 2 sets
  
  2)If they are equal 
  
  3)If one of them is a subset of the other
  
  4)Their union
  
  5)Their intersection 
  
  6)Their difference
